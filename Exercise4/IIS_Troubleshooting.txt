Windows web application troubleshooting in IIS:

Got Service unavailable 503 exception when accessing http://localhost/ in browser
IIS version: 10

Checked the IIS status in command line

iisreset/status
Status for IIS Admin Service ( IISADMIN ) : Stopped
Status for Windows Process Activation Service ( WAS ) : Running
Status for World Wide Web Publishing Service ( W3SVC ) : Running

Noticed that DefaultAppPool keeps stopping automatically, 
Changed the process model identity in advanced settings to recommended value to fix this.
In IIS Manager: Application pools -> DefaultAppPool -> Advanced Settings -> Process Model -> Identity -> ApplicationPoolIdentity

After this, Recycled the application pool tasks
Then I'm able to access the IIS web page in http://localhost/ successfully
